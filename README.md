Depth Sonification

Sonification of depth, using a Kinect camera and Pure Data. The image is resized to a 13x7 grid. 
So 91 samples are played, one for each pixel, and their sound is controlled by Depth value.
This prototype is being programmed upon request of Giles Hamilton-Fletcher of the University of Sussex.
